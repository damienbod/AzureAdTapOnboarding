# Azure AD Temporary Access Pass (TAP) Onboarding

[![.NET](https://github.com/damienbod/AzureAdTapOnboarding/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/damienbod/AzureAdTapOnboarding/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

## Test Cases

- A guest flow with email code
- A guest flow with federated login
- A guest flow with phone login (is this possible?)
- A member flow with TAP and FIDO2 auth
- A member flow with password using email/password auth
- A member flow with password setup and a phone auth

### Open tasks

- Add documentation of the different onboarding flows
- Switch to delegated Graph permissions
- Evaluate this with a Multi-tenant App Registration using delegated flows

## Using Temporary Access Pass (TAP) with members

Note: TAP only works with members and a passwordless authentication once setup

## Creating AAD member users

Users are created on the tenant with a known or registered domain. The member user can use a TAP to onboard or a password.

When using TAP, no password is returned and the user must register a FIDO2 key, etc.

## Creating AAD guest users

And email with a domain unknown or not registered on the tenant will be created using an invite.

TAP cannot be used for guests.
